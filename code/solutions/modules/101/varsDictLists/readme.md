Task 1: Collect Server Information

The script collects server names from the user and stores them in a list.
append() is used to add elements to the list.

Task 2: Assign IP Addresses to Servers

A dictionary is used to store server names as keys and their IP addresses as values.
A for loop iterates through the server list to populate the dictionary.

Task 3: Display Server Details

The script checks if the entered server exists in the dictionary using an if-else statement.
If found, it prints the server details; otherwise, it displays an error message.

Task 4: Modify Server Configurations

The script asks the user if they want to update an IP address.
If the server exists, it updates the dictionary with the new IP address.
